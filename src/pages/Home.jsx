            <h2>ABOUT EXPLORISTORY</h2>

            <p>
              Exploristory is an experiential learning initiative that brings
              history and archaeology to life by transforming them from subjects
              of rote learning into journeys of discovery, curiosity, and
              critical thinking. Through immersive field experiences, mock
              excavations, artefact analysis, historical simulations, and
              interactive learning labs, it enables learners to actively engage
              with the past and experience history as a dynamic, hands-on
              process of exploration.
